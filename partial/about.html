    <h3>ABOUT THIS SITE</h3>
    <p>I designed and coded this website in Jan 2015. Beyond AngularJS(and UI-Router), every line of HTML, CSS(SASS), JavaScript is coded from scratch. I practiced to build event emitting directives, to build an simple SASS grid framework, to create responsive layouts, to pre-load images using JavaScript before page transition, etc... I really enjoy the process and will keep updating the website.</p>
    <p>If there is a bug or any other issue regarding this website, I'll be appreciate if you <a href="mailto:fskuok@yahoo.com">tell me.</a></p>
