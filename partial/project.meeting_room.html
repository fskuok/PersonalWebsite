        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <h4>
            Inefficiency is caused by lots of different factors: lack of focus, unproductive activities, lack of proper documentation, losing track of times...

        <h4>
            The goal was to improve meeting efficiencies by creating a smart meeting room that leverages the capabilities of connected products for information management and interaction reduction.

        <h3>Realizing the Concept</h3>
        <p>The Spark platform was used to prototype the system rapidly because of its wi-fi module, compatibility with many Arduino libraries and ready Cloud capabilities.
            <br/>Objects in the room are monitored through sensors and their status is updated onto the cloud. Objects are controlled by calling functions from the cloud.
            <br/>The agenda web-page and other devices that are connected to the internet directly interact with the spark platform through RESTful API.</p>

    <p class="span-4">Google Spreadsheet is used to enter in the meeting agenda for userfriendly, familiar experience. User just need to put in the topic, start time, end time and type of each event.
        <br/>The agenda keeps the meeting going on time.  It keeps track of time, the progress of the meeting and co-ordinates the function of other devices around the room that are time dependant. A few of these functions include, making coffee when its time for a break or dimming the light while turning on the projector/tv when its time for a presentation.

    <div class="span-1"></div>
    <p class="span-4">When the meeting is about to begin, open the agenda app, then the agenda app will fetch agenda data through Google Doc API. Then the agenda will start to listen to two types of events:
        <br/>1. time events: based on the agenda data, (e.g. 2 minutes before the coffee break);
        <br/>2. events from devices

        <br/>When there is a matched handler for a triggered event, agenda will execute the handler and use Spark Cloud API to communicate will connected devices. (e.g. turn on the coffee maker and make coffee according to attending people when it is 2 mins before coffee break.)</p>
